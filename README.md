# TCP-flood_detection_in_SDN
A project to detect TCP flood attack in Software Defined Network (SDN) using AI algorithm.

In this project I will try to write a code to detect TCP SYN flood attack in SDN. This program was written step by step as a Master thesis project and now I will rewrite it and fix buges.

## Requirements:
  - Install Python
  - Download Mininet 
  - Install POX controller
